# `3. Code Patterns And Style Practices`

## ![‚úî] 3.1 Use ESLint

**TL;DR:** [ESLint](https://eslint.org) is the de-facto standard for checking possible code errors and fixing code style, not only to identify nitty-gritty spacing issues but also to detect serious code anti-patterns like developers throwing errors without classification. Though ESLint can automatically fix code styles, other tools like [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) are more powerful in formatting the fix and work in conjunction with ESLint

**Otherwise:** Developers will focus on tedious spacing and line-width concerns and time might be wasted overthinking the project's code style

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.2 Use Node.js eslint extension plugins

### `üìù #updated`

**TL;DR:** On top of ESLint standard rules that cover vanilla JavaScript, add Node.js specific plugins like [eslint-plugin-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-node), [eslint-plugin-mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-mocha) and [eslint-plugin-node-security](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-security), [eslint-plugin-require](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-require), [/eslint-plugin-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jest) and other useful rules

**Otherwise:** Many faulty Node.js code patterns might escape under the radar. For example, developers might require(variableAsPath) files with a variable given as a path which allows attackers to execute any JS script. Node.js linters can detect such patterns and complain early

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.3 Start a Codeblock's Curly Braces on the Same Line

**TL;DR:** The opening curly braces of a code block should be on the same line as the opening statement

### Code Example

```javascript
// Do
function someFunction() {
  // code block
}

// Avoid
function someFunction()
{
  // code block
}
```

**Otherwise:** Deferring from this best practice might lead to unexpected results, as seen in the StackOverflow thread below:

üîó [**Read more:** "Why do results vary based on curly brace placement?" (StackOverflow)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3641519/why-does-a-results-vary-based-on-curly-brace-placement)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.4 Separate your statements properly

No matter if you use semicolons or not to separate your statements, knowing the common pitfalls of improper linebreaks or automatic semicolon insertion, will help you to eliminate regular syntax errors.

**TL;DR:** Use ESLint to gain awareness about separation concerns. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [Standardjs](https://standardjs.com/) can automatically resolve these issues.

**Otherwise:** As seen in the previous section, JavaScript's interpreter automatically adds a semicolon at the end of a statement if there isn't one, or considers a statement as not ended where it should, which might lead to some undesired results. You can use assignments and avoid using immediately invoked function expressions to prevent most of the unexpected errors.

### Code example

```javascript
// Do
function doThing() {
    // ...
}

doThing()

// Do

const items = [1, 2, 3]
items.forEach(console.log)

// Avoid ‚Äî throws exception
const m = new Map()
const a = [1,2,3]
[...m.values()].forEach(console.log)
> [...m.values()].forEach(console.log)
>  ^^^
> SyntaxError: Unexpected token ...

// Avoid ‚Äî throws exception
const count = 2 // it tries to run 2(), but 2 is not a function
(function doSomething() {
  // do something amazing
}())
// put a semicolon before the immediate invoked function, after the const definition, save the return value of the anonymous function to a variable or avoid IIFEs altogether
```

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.5 Name your functions

**TL;DR:** Name all functions, including closures and callbacks. Avoid anonymous functions. This is especially useful when profiling a node app. Naming all functions will allow you to easily understand what you're looking at when checking a memory snapshot

**Otherwise:** Debugging production issues using a core dump (memory snapshot) might become challenging as you notice significant memory consumption from anonymous functions

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.6 Use naming conventions for variables, constants, functions and classes

**TL;DR:** Use **_lowerCamelCase_** when naming constants, variables and functions, **_UpperCamelCase_** (capital first letter as well) when naming classes and **_UPPER_SNAKE_CASE_** when naming global or static variables. This will help you to easily distinguish between plain variables, functions, classes that require instantiation and variables declared at global module scope. Use descriptive names, but try to keep them short

**Otherwise:** JavaScript is the only language in the world that allows invoking a constructor ("Class") directly without instantiating it first. Consequently, Classes and function-constructors are differentiated by starting with UpperCamelCase

### 3.6 Code Example

```javascript
// for global variables names we use the const/let keyword and UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
let MUTABLE_GLOBAL = "mutable value";
const GLOBAL_CONSTANT = "immutable value";
const CONFIG = {
  key: "value",
};

// examples of UPPER_SNAKE_CASE convention in nodejs/javascript ecosystem
// in javascript Math.PI module
const PI = 3.141592653589793;

// https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/b9f36062d7b5c5039498e98d2f2c180dca2a7065/lib/internal/http2/core.js#L303
// in nodejs http2 module
const HTTP_STATUS_OK = 200;
const HTTP_STATUS_CREATED = 201;

// for class name we use UpperCamelCase
class SomeClassExample {
  // for static class properties we use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
  static STATIC_PROPERTY = "value";
}

// for functions names we use lowerCamelCase
function doSomething() {
  // for scoped variable names we use the const/let keyword and lowerCamelCase
  const someConstExample = "immutable value";
  let someMutableExample = "mutable value";
}
```

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.7 Prefer const over let. Ditch the var

**TL;DR:** Using `const` means that once a variable is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. Preferring `const` will help you to not be tempted to use the same variable for different uses, and make your code clearer. If a variable needs to be reassigned, in a for loop, for example, use `let` to declare it. Another important aspect of `let` is that a variable declared using it is only available in the block scope in which it was defined. `var` is function scoped, not block-scoped, and [shouldn't be used in ES6](https://hackernoon.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-var-anymore-f109a58b9b70) now that you have `const` and `let` at your disposal

**Otherwise:** Debugging becomes way more cumbersome when following a variable that frequently changes

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.8 Require modules first, not inside functions

**TL;DR:** Require modules at the beginning of each file, before and outside of any functions. This simple best practice will not only help you easily and quickly tell the dependencies of a file right at the top but also avoids a couple of potential problems

**Otherwise:** Requires are run synchronously by Node.js. If they are called from within a function, it may block other requests from being handled at a more critical time. Also, if a required module or any of its dependencies throw an error and crash the server, it is best to find out about it as soon as possible, which might not be the case if that module is required from within a function

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.9 Set an explicit entry point to a module/folder

### `üìù #updated`

**TL;DR:** When developing a module/library, set an explicit root file that exports the public and interesting code. Discourage the client code from importing deep files and becoming familiar with the internal structure. With commonjs (require), this can be done with an index.js file at the folder's root or the package.json.main field. With ESM (import), if a package.json exists on the root, the field "exports" allow specifying the module's root file. If no package.json exists, you may put an index.js file on the root which re-exports all the public functionality

**Otherwise:** Having an explicit root file acts like a public 'interface' that encapsulates the internal, directs the caller to the public code and facilitates future changes without breaking the contract

### 3.9 Code example - avoid coupling the client to the module structure

```javascript
// Avoid: client has deep familiarity with the internals

// Client code
const SMSWithMedia = require("./SMSProvider/providers/media/media-provider.js");

// Better: explicitly export the public functions

//index.js, module code
module.exports.SMSWithMedia = require("./SMSProvider/providers/media/media-provider.js");

// Client code
const { SMSWithMedia } = require("./SMSProvider");
```

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.10 Use the `===` operator

**TL;DR:** Prefer the strict equality operator `===` over the weaker abstract equality operator `==`. `==` will compare two variables after converting them to a common type. There is no type conversion in `===`, and both variables must be of the same type to be equal

**Otherwise:** Unequal variables might return true when compared with the `==` operator

### 3.10 Code example

```javascript
"" == "0"; // false
0 == ""; // true
0 == "0"; // true

false == "false"; // false
false == "0"; // true

false == undefined; // false
false == null; // false
null == undefined; // true

" \t\r\n " == 0; // true
```

All statements above will return false if used with `===`

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.11 Use Async Await, avoid callbacks

**TL;DR:** Async-await is the simplest way to express an asynchronous flow as it makes asynchronous code look synchronous. Async-await will also result in much more compact code and support for try-catch. This technique now supersedes callbacks and promises in _most_ cases. Using it in your code is probably the best gift one can give to the code reader

**Otherwise:** Handling async errors in callback style are probably the fastest way to hell - this style forces to check errors all over, deal with awkward code nesting, and makes it difficult to reason about the code flow

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.12 Use arrow function expressions (=>)

**TL;DR:** Though it's recommended to use async-await and avoid function parameters when dealing with older APIs that accept promises or callbacks - arrow functions make the code structure more compact and keep the lexical context of the root function (i.e. `this`)

**Otherwise:** Longer code (in ES5 functions) is more prone to bugs and cumbersome to read

üîó [**Read more: It‚Äôs Time to Embrace Arrow Functions**](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/familiarity-bias-is-holding-you-back-its-time-to-embrace-arrow-functions-3d37e1a9bb75)

<br/><br/>

## ![‚úî] 3.13 Avoid effects outside of functions

### `üåü #new`

**TL;DR:** Avoid putting code with effects like network or DB calls outside of functions. Such a code will be executed immediately when another file requires the file. This 'floating' code might get executed when the underlying system is not ready yet. It also comes with a performance penalty even when this module's functions will finally not be used in runtime. Last, mocking these DB/network calls for testing is harder outside of functions. Instead, put this code inside functions that should get called explicitly. If some DB/network code must get executed right when the module loads, consider using the factory or revealing module patterns

**Otherwise:** A typical web framework sets error handler, environment variables and monitoring. When DB/network calls are made before the web framework is initialized, they won't be monitored or fail due to a lack of configuration data
